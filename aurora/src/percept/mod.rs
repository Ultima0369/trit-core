//! External perception layer — unified abstraction for all perception sources.
//!
//! The `ExternalPercept` trait provides a standard interface for converting
//! raw text input into `PerceptBatch` — a structured set of TritWord signals
//! with metadata. Implementations include cloud LLMs, local models, and
//! the built-in FFT wavelet engine.
//!
//! # 流沙 (Flowing Sands) Philosophy
//!
//! Every perception provider is a **棱镜 (prism)** — it decomposes raw input
//! into independent spectral components without interpreting what they mean.
//!
//! - **璇玑 (Armillary Sphere)**: faithfully rotate, never explain why
//! - **棱镜 (Prism)**: split into spectral bands, never synthesize
//! - **微风 (Breeze)**: pass through, leave no trace
//!
//! The LLM perceives and structures signals. Trit-Core makes ternary decisions.
//! The user observes their own reaction to the data. No one tells anyone what to think.
//!
